## Overview

The primary task of this project was to analyze raw transaction logs to derive meaningful business metrics for an e-commerce store. The original dataset captures user activities on the company's website, including product page views, shopping cart interactions, and purchases. The goal of the spreadsheet is to present polished insights to the executive team, highlighting key results and analytical decisions.

## The Process

Reviewed, cleaned, and filtered raw data that an e-commerce store gathered over a six-month period. Built a conversion funnel to understand user interactions and find the percent of users that made it from viewing an item, to adding it to the shopping cart, to making an actual purchase. Prepared data for cohort analysis by isolating purchases and finding each user's first purchase date. The cohorts were defined by the month of first purchase, and the cohort age was based on how many months passed since the first purchase. Calculated retention rates of customers over time based on the cohort data. Included a table of contents and an Executive Summary sheet for an overview of the process and results.

## Results

By meticulously analyzing conversion and retention metrics, this project offers actionable insights for optimizing the e-commerce store's performance and fostering sustained customer engagement:


1. Conversion Rates Findings: The funnel analysis revealed a prominent drop in conversion rates from website visitation to cart addition, with only 29.04% progressing to the cart while 35.61% of those customers complete a purchase. Addressing website aesthetics and navigation pathways could enhance user experience and streamline the purchase journey.

2. Retention Rates Findings: Users who made initial purchases in September and October demonstrated higher retention rates. However, retention rates witnessed a substantial decline across all cohorts, particularly from the first to the second month. Simplifying store design and implementing loyalty initiatives may mitigate user attrition and foster long-term engagement.

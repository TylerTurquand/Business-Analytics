## Overview

The primary task of this project involves analyzing raw transaction logs to derive meaningful business metrics. The original dataset captures user activities on the company's website, including product page views, shopping cart interactions, and purchases. Tasks include building a conversion funnel to understand user interactions, preparing data for cohort analysis by isolating purchases and calculating first purchase dates, and calculating retention rates based on cohort data. The spreadsheet organization and documentation aim to present polished insights to the executive team, highlighting key results and analysis decisions.

## Results

1. Conversion Rates Findings: The funnel analysis revealed a prominent drop in conversion rates from website visitation to cart addition, with only 29.04% progressing to the cart while 35.61% of those customers complete a purchase. Addressing website aesthetics and navigation pathways could enhance user experience and streamline the purchase journey.

2. Retention Rates Findings: Users who made initial purchases in September and October demonstrated higher retention rates. However, retention rates witnessed a substantial decline across all cohorts, particularly from the first to the second month. Simplifying store design and implementing loyalty initiatives may mitigate user attrition and foster long-term engagement.

By meticulously analyzing conversion and retention metrics, this project offers actionable insights for optimizing the e-commerce store's performance and fostering sustained customer engagement.
